        The only way we could<br>
        feel close to the girls was<br>
        through these impossible<br>
        trips which have scarred<br> 
        us forever, making us<br> 
        happier with dreams<br>
        than wives.<br><br> 
        Collecting everything we<br> 
        could of theirs, the Lisbon<br> 
        girls wouldn't leave our minds.<br> 
        But they were slipping away...<br>
        </p>
        <p id="text2">
        The colour of their eyes was<br>
        fading, along with the locations<br>
        of moles and dimples.<br><br>
        From five they had become four,<br> 
        and they were all living in the<br>
        dead, becoming shadows.<br><br>
        We'd have lost them completely<br>
        if they hadn't contacted us.<br>

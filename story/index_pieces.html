        We had pieces of the puzzle, <br>
        but however we put them <br>
        together, gaps remained. <br>
        Oddly shaped emptiness, <br>
        mapped by what surrounded them <br> 
        like countries we couldn't name.

        <p id="text2">
        What lingered after them was not life, <br>
        but the most trivial<br>
        list of mundane facts...<br>
        ..a clock ticking on the wall,...<br>
        ..a room dim at noon,...<br>
        ..the outrageousness of a human<br>
        being thinking only of herself.

        <p id="text3">
        We began the impossible process <br>
        of trying to forget them.

        The girls' only contact with the outside was through catalogues they<br> 
        ordered that filled their mailbox with pictures of high-end fashions<br> 
        and brochures for exotic vacations. Unable to go anywhere, the girls<br> 
        travelled in their imaginations to Siamese temples or passed an old<br> 
        man with a leaf broom tidying a moss-carpeted speck of Japan. We<br> 
        ordered the same catalogues and, flipping through the pages, we<br>
        hiked through passes with the girls, stopping every now and then<br> 
        to help them with their backpacks, placing our hands on their warm,<br>
        moist shoulders and gazing off at papaya sunsets. We drank tea with<br> 
        them in a water pavilion. We did whatever we wanted.<br>
